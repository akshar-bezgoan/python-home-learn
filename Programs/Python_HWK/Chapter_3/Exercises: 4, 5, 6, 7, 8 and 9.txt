Exercise 4 {

    Code {

        s = "HumptyDumpty"
        print("s= ", s)
        print(s.isalpha)
        print(s.isdigit)
        print(s.isalnum)
        print(s.islower)
        print(s.isupper)
        print(s.startswith("Hump"))
        print(s.endswith("Dump"))

    }


    Output {

        s = HumptyDumpty
        True
        False
        False
        False
        False
        True
        False

Exercise 5 {

    Raw string are strings that is a raw form of a string.
    This means it will be a basic version of the completed string by being able to add things like quotation marks 
    (not being used as a symbol for closing or opening strings) and backslashes (not being used as an escape character)

}

Exercise 6 {

    The function ord() converts a string with len() = 1 to its ASCII int equivalent - eg: ord("A") = 65
    if len(chr(ord(input))) > 1:
        print("TypeError: ord() expected a character, but string of length 2 found")

    As you can see I used the chr() function. This is the opposite of the ord() function so I can find 
    what the input in the ord() function was. This is used to convert a number to its ASCII str equivalent.
    eg: chr(65) = "A"
    type(chr(65)) = <class str> 

}

Exercise 7 {

    Each string is an object of the <class str> built-in-type

}

Exercise 8 {

    string = "The difference with stupidity and genius is that genius has its limits"
    word_list = string.split(" ") 
    print(word_list)

}


Exercise 9{

    a = 8
    b = 7
    c = 5
    d = 6
    e = 2
    f = 3
    g = 3
    h = 18
